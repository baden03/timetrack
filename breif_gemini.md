## Project Title

TimeTrack

## Problem Statement

Freelancers, consultants, and small businesses need an efficient and streamlined way to track time spent on client projects for accurate billing and to gain insights into time allocation.

## Project Goal

Develop a web-based time-tracking application that provides the following core features:

* **Client Management:** Create, store, and manage client profiles with basic information.
* **Project Tracking:** Set up projects, associate them with clients, and add optional descriptions.
* **Time Entry:** Log time entries with start/end times (or duration), project association, and short descriptions. Allow for entries on past dates.
* **Category-Based Tracking:** Assign categories to time entries (design, development, etc.) with associated hourly rates.
* **Reporting:** Generate basic monthly reports summarizing total time spent per project, per category, and associated billable costs.

## Technical Considerations

* **Frontend:** React (consider Next.js for potential advantages)
* **Backend:** Node.js with Express.js
* **Database:** MariaDB or MySQL
* **Authentication:** Google Authentication

## Scope (Initial)

* Focus on core functionality outlined above.
* Prioritize a user-friendly, uncluttered interface.

## Potential Future Expansions

* **Advanced Reporting:** Customizable reports, filtering by date ranges, breakdown by client.
* **Expense Tracking:** Log project-related expenses.
* **Invoicing:** Integrate invoicing capabilities directly within the app.
